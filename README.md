# üìù LeetCode 75 Daily Progress Tracker

This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily solutions to the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/) problems. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and maintain consistency in practicing coding interview questions.

## Purpose

- **Practice:** Strengthen my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keep a record of daily problem-solving activity.
- **Interview Preparation:** Build a repository of solutions for future reference.

## Structure

- Each day's solution is committed with the problem number, name, and timestamp.
- Solutions are written in **C#** and organized in simple console applications.
- The `LeetCodes` file contains implementations and comments for each solved problem.

## Example

```csharp
// 1768. Merge Strings Alternatively - 00:07:10
