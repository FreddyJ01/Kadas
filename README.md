# LeetCode 75 Daily Progress Tracker

This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily solutions to the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/) problems. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and maintain consistency in practicing coding interview questions.

## Purpose

- **Practice:** Strengthen my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keep a record of daily problem-solving activity.
- **Interview Preparation:** Build a repository of solutions for future reference.

## Structure

- Each day's solution is committed with the problem number, name, and timestamp.
- Solutions are written in **C#** and organized in simple console applications.
- The `ConsoleApp2/Program.cs` file contains implementations and comments for each solved problem.

## Example

```csharp
// 1768. Merge Strings Alternatively - 00:07:10
public static string MergeAlternately(string word1, string word2)
{
    // Implementation
}

// 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies - 00:27:07
public IList<bool> KidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FreddyJ01/Kanas.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Browse the `ConsoleApp2/Program.cs` file for daily solutions and comments.

## Progress

Check the commits for daily updates and timestamps for each problem solved.
